                        The passenger is himself responsible for procuring passports, visas and similar travel
                        documents.
                        In cases at the border crossing, problems arise with these travel documents caused by the
                        traveler
                        We cannot wait longer than the time allowed by the timetable.
                        If the passenger cannot continue the journey with the bus due to this, the passenger has no
                        right to compensation from PETERS BUSS AB This also applies if the passenger is detained by the
                        Police, Passport or Customs authorities for investigation</p>

                    <p>Comfort and safety: It is not permitted to bring backpacks and suitcases into the passenger
                        compartment. A smaller handbag to take documents, money, reading material and water is fine.
                        Food, soft drinks, tea, coffee may not be brought or consumed inside the bus.

                        The traveler must follow the tour guide's instructions regarding comfort and safety and order on
                        board the bus and during the trip. It is not permitted to smoke in the bus, or bring and consume
                        alcohol so that fellow travelers are disturbed by loud and drunk people, these are only told
                        once by the staff on the bus, after which measures are taken
                        Nor to litter or damage the interior, or other people's property.

                        The travel company reserves the right to prosecute such conduct by means of compensation claims,
                        and ultimately rejection with compensation claims from the bus company.

                        PETERS BUSS AB reserves the right to continue the trip according to plan when the time specified
                        has not been kept by the traveler without him.

                        Passengers who are dropped off or dropped off are not entitled to compensation from PETERS BUSS
                        AB for this. PETERS BUSS AB does not compensate for lost or damaged tax-free goods or other
                        goods that are not considered luggage.
                        Tax-free goods may, however, be brought along but at your own risk. Due to the limited cargo
                        space on the bus, all passengers are entitled to bring a normal suitcase weighing 5-10 kg, plus
                        a handbag that can be placed under their own seat without causing inconvenience to other
                        passengers.
                        If you want to bring extra luggage, always ask the office first.
                        All suitcases and other luggage must be provided with name tags that must contain your name.
                        The ticket price does not include any travel insurance, therefore we recommend taking out
                        separate travel insurance that is valid during the trip. We do not transport any luggage without
                        passengers.
