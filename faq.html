                <div>
                    <h3>Billing and payment</h3>
                    <p>The bill usually comes between 4 and 3 weeks before departure
                        We do not send partial payments, but the entire bill is sent at once
                        It can also be sent out somewhat earlier if the trip is fully booked
                        The bill also includes a travel program

                        The bill and program are only sent to the person who has given the address at the time of
                        booking

                        An unpaid bill is not considered a cancellation, but the cancellation is not completed before
                        you have received a cancellation notice from our office (see Travel Terms and Conditions)

                        Bills are not sent out if we see that the number of participants is too few (under 10 people)

                        Should the trip be canceled due to too few participants, the message will be sent no later than
                        2 weeks before the planned departure to the phone number you provided when booking</p>

                    <h3>Cancellation?</h3>
                    <p>Should the trip be cancelled..
                        Please let us know if you have not received the bill and information about 10 days before
                        departure

                        Then you might have time to book another trip or move to another departure date that we know
                        will go

                        The bill will not be sent until we see that the trip will be completed, so you pay nothing until
                        the bill and travel program reach you

                        If the bill arrives earlier, the departure is guaranteed

                        Many trips go, of course, but there may be dates that are not suitable for people to travel, so
                        the bookings will be few

                        A few times, the shipping company can charter the entire ship at short notice, causing the trip
                        to fall because of this.

                        In very extreme weather or ice conditions the trip can be canceled at very short notice but this
                        has never happened to us since 1997
                        We hope you understand that a trip may be cancelled
